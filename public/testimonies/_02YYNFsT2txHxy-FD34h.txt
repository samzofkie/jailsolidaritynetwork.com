The jail conditions:
The jail is so dirty. There's black mold everywhere from the showers to the dayroom area bathroom. The food is horrible. We eat bread all day and are not allowed to work out or go outside. We have one uniform and when we do get to work out they don't give us clean uniforms after. The commissary prices are ridiculous. 

Connect with a friend outside:
I would really like to speak to new people out there. I only talk to my family but I would love new friends. 

Identify with outside resources:
I would like to know what resources are available for me when I get out.

Support activism and advocacy hoping to do while inside:
I would like to be part of movements if I was educated on them.

Facilities:
The facilities don't give a deep clean, they're not giving us bleach to clean only water with vinegar. The living conditions have taken a toll on my health by having rashes, hives, and COVID-19. I have not been in the hole but I used to clean it up as a building worker in Div 9. The way they get treated is horrible although it's for disciplinary purposes. 

Education and programming:
I have been able to participate in the Div 6 program tier which gives us GED classes, yoga, and more. I have been able to learn a lot and stay out of trouble. 

Surveillance:
Some books sent through the mail have been confiscated because they claim they're suspicious that they have contraband for having stains or an odor. Not every book I can get will be brand new.

Emotional needs:
The jail has impacted my mental health in many ways, one is being around mentally ill people, another one is not being able to go outside, and long continued court dates. It's very lonely because I don't associate with many positive people so It's best to stay away from people. I do have support from my family but I feel disappointed by the fact that they have to go through this with me. Those visits have been great but It's an experience that takes a toll on my mental health.
