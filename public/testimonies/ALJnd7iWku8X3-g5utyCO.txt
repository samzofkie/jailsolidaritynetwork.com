The trauma I have suffered in the 11 years of pretrial has taken a toll on my mental health that probably can never be reversed. If I'm honest with myself I'm not even fit to return to society. If anything I've become a real criminal way more criminal minded than before I was detained.

I was 24 when I got detained. I'm 36 now. During my 11 years of pretrial all of my alibi witnesses have passed away. I did a prison bit before I ever stood trial, This long detention and delay of justice made it so I could never receive a fair trial.

I was never given an opportunity to better myself. No school or programs for max detainees and the programs that do exist are based on choosing who can participate. The only thing I've learned is that this system is racist and unjust and rehabilitation is a joke. Further the county jail holds detainees for years and years but has no resources to rehabilitate.
