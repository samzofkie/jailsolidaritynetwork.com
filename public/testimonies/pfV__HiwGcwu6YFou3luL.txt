Facilities: No, the facility I am in is not clean. Yes, I constantly get bit by bugs and break out in rashes. Yes, depressing seeing mental health really affects society and they need more mental health awareness outside. It is also very dirty. It smells like a farmhouse all the time.

Discrimination: Yes, being a minority I need more access to hair products in the facility I am detained in, like hair shampoo, hair conditioner, and hair grease. The women have it here but we don't. And I had to make my own hair grease to keep my hair from falling out and having dandruff problems.

Education and programming: Yes, access to programs have helped with my anxiety of being detained for as long as I have. The programs show me my voice is valuable. No, not freely, it's more of a fight to get access to these things rather than being given. I work out, meditate, read, write poems, web charts of my goals for when I am released, and write my music.

Surveillance: Yes, no matter what, they can't stop my voice if I want the environment to change, I have to speak up about it. I don't allow my current situation to stop me. No, because we deal with constant shakedowns. They go through our mail, pictures, and legal mail and shakedowns. No matter what, we have no privacy. They monitor everything we do, even on in person or video visits. Yes, pens have been taken, blankets, sheets, DOC uniforms, hats, gloves, Holy Cross memorabilia. Often their reasons are to stop smoking drugs. Even if your tier isn't smoking, they treat you like you are. It has given me constant anxiety because you never know when they are going to come, I am always on guard just in case they come while I'm asleep.

Emotional needs: A lot made me more anxious, at times more succumb to violence because unfortunately you have to survive. At night, when I don't talk to my family or whenever I get off the phone I feel alone, because I am by myself, doing the time by myself at times it feels like.
